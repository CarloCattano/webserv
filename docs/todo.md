MIME types for files upload
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types

 - Cant forward css or images since the content-type needs to dinamically change depending 
   if they request the index.html -> content-type text/html , css -> text/css , images etc

CGI bins , python? php ? do we need both ?

RFC only check the MUST
